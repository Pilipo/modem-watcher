## Details and Models Supported

This script loads the web interface for you Motorola surfboard and parses the page. It grabs details related to the status of the device and its signal strength. All the details are written to SYSLOG with the application stamp of "modem-watcher."

Currently, this script has only been tested using a model **SB6121 Motorola** Surfboard. I am interested in hearing about your success and failure on a specific model number.
